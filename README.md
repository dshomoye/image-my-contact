## Contact Image Generator.
This app was mainly a means for me to spend a couple hours to learn [Svelte](https://svelte.dev). Still, having images for all my contacts is something I've always wanted and never quite found a good solution for. Currently only supports [vCards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VCard) not much plan to use any contact/people APIs, vCards are pretty much universal so any service can export/import them.

Live app is [here](https://image-my-contact.vercel.app)
